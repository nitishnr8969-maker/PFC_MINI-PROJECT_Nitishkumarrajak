Algorithm for Palindrome Number Checker

Start the program.

Prompt the user to enter an integer number.

Read the number from the user.

Store the original number in a separate variable.

Initialize a variable reverse to 0.

Repeat the following steps until the number becomes 0:

Extract the last digit using modulo operation (digit = num % 10).

Add the digit to the reversed number (reverse = reverse * 10 + digit).

Remove the last digit from the number (num = num / 10).

Compare the reversed number with the original number.

If both are equal, display “Palindrome Number”.

Otherwise, display “Not a Palindrome Number”.

End the program.

Purpose of the Code

To check whether a given number is a palindrome or not.

To understand number manipulation in C programming.

To practice important programming concepts such as:

Loops

Conditional statements

Arithmetic operations

Variables and data types

To improve logical thinking and problem-solving skills.

Expected Outcomes

The user is prompted to enter a number.

If the number reads the same forward and backward: The program prints “Palindrome Number”.

If the number changes when reversed: The program prints “Not a Palindrome Number”.

Users learn how to reverse a number and apply comparison logic.

Future Use / Applications

Used in basic programming practice and academic projects.

Helpful in interview and competitive programming questions.

Can be extended to check:

Palindrome strings

Palindrome words or sentences
